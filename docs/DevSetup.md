# O-Hack Development Environment Setup
Opportunity Hack site uses NextJS which makes most things pretty easy.
This page provides a couple of things you will still need to do to
get you development environment up and running.

Developers can set up their environments on their local computers or use
Codespaces. We recomend that develoers use VSCode if they choose to 
develop on their local computers. 

## Fork the OHACK repository.
You will need to fork either the 
[frontend-ohack.dev](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/frontend-ohack.dev) 
reositor or 
[backend-ohack.dev](https://github.com/opportunity-hack/backend-ohack.dev) 
repository or both. All pull requests (PR) must be done from your fork. 
All code should be pushed to your private fork. Frome your fork, generate
you PR.

## IDE Setup
As stated, developers can use either a local (on you local PC) or Codespaces.
There are pros and cons to both. 
| Setup | Pros | Cons |
|:-----:|:----:|:----:|
| Codespaces | All NodeJS is set up.<br>Your VSCode IDE is set up. | Code is remote. <br> You must be online.|
| Local | All your code is local. | You need to set all NodeJS tools.<br>You need to set up your IDE. |
