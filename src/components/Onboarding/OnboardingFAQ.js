          We typically host projects on GitHub under the Opportunity Hack organization, which provides version control and collaboration tools. 
          For deployment, we use a variety of platforms depending on the project's needs. Many web applications are deployed on Heroku, Vercel, 
          or Netlify, which offer free tiers for nonprofit projects. For more complex applications requiring custom infrastructure, we work with 
          cloud providers like AWS, GCP, or Azure, often utilizing their nonprofit credits programs. Our DevOps team helps set up deployment 
          pipelines and monitors application health. We prioritize sustainable, low-maintenance hosting solutions that nonprofits can manage

          available for others to learn from and potentially adapt for similar use cases. In special cases where nonprofits have specific

          Unlike traditional hackathons, we emphasize long-term project development and sustainability. After a hackathon ends, 
          projects typically enter our "continued development" phase. Teams often continue working on their solutions, refining 
          features, addressing bugs, and ensuring the project meets the nonprofit's needs. We have a dedicated project maintenance 
          team that helps ensure projects remain active and supported. For projects that have reached a stable state, we provide 
          documentation and training to nonprofits on how to use and maintain their solutions. Some projects may evolve over multiple 
          hackathons, with new teams building upon previous work. Our goal is to create lasting impact, not just weekend prototypes.

          Opportunity Hack operates through a combination of corporate sponsorships, individual donations, and in-kind support. 
          Our corporate partners provide financial resources, volunteer time from their employees, and often technical infrastructure. 
          We maintain a lean operation with minimal overhead costs, as most of our work is done by volunteers. Funds are primarily used 
          for hackathon expenses, technical infrastructure, and occasionally small stipends for long-term project maintenance. We're 
          committed to transparency in our finances, and information about our sponsors and how funds are used is available upon request. 
          As a nonprofit initiative ourselves, we're focused on maximizing impact rather than generating revenue.
