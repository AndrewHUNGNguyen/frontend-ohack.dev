# OHack Analytics Enhancement Strategy

## Current Implementation Assessment

The current implementation has several strengths:
- Page view tracking across routes
- Button click tracking for key CTAs
- Basic form interaction tracking
- User identification via email
- Dual-platform tracking (GA + Facebook Pixel)

However, from a marketing perspective, there are significant gaps:

1. **Inconsistent Event Naming**: Events use varied naming patterns making analysis difficult
2. **Incomplete User Journey Tracking**: No funnel tracking for key conversion paths
3. **Limited User Segmentation**: Not leveraging user properties effectively
4. **Missing Engagement Metrics**: No scroll depth or time-on-content tracking
5. **Inadequate Conversion Attribution**: UTM parameter handling is incomplete
6. **Donation Flow Tracking**: No structured ecommerce-style tracking for donations

## Recommended Implementation Improvements

### 1. Standardized Event Tracking Architecture

Implement a consistent event naming convention following this pattern:
```
category_action_object
```

For example:
- `navigation_click_slack` instead of `slack_button`
- `form_submit_hackathon` instead of generic `submit`
- `content_view_nonprofit` for nonprofit profile views

### 2. Enhanced User Journey Tracking

Implement step-by-step funnel tracking for key user journeys:

**Volunteer Journey:**
1. Site visit
2. Nonprofit project view
3. Slack signup
4. Profile creation
5. Team joining
6. Project contribution

**Nonprofit Journey:**
1. Site visit
2. Project submission form start
3. Form completion steps
4. Submission
5. Follow-up actions

### 3. Advanced User Segmentation

Enhance user property tracking:
- Role-based segmentation
- Experience level
- Interest areas
- Activity frequency

### 4. Content Engagement Metrics

Add tracking for:
- Scroll depth on key pages
- Time spent on content
- Content shares
- Return visits to content

### 5. Conversion Attribution

Implement proper UTM tracking:
- Capture all UTM parameters
- Store first and last touch attribution
- Track referral sources across sessions

### 6. Enhanced Donation Tracking

Implement analytics similar to e-commerce tracking:
- Donation funnel steps
- Donation amounts as revenue
- Donation abandonment tracking

## Technical Implementation Plan

1. Create a centralized analytics service with standardized tracking methods
2. Implement custom dimensions for segmentation
3. Add event tracking middleware 
4. Create automated reporting dashboards
5. Implement A/B testing framework

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Improved Conversion Rates**: Identify and optimize drop-off points
2. **Enhanced User Targeting**: Better segmentation for personalized messaging
3. **Content Optimization**: Data-driven content strategy
4. **Increased Donations**: Optimized donation flows
5. **Better Resource Allocation**: Focus on highest-impact activities
