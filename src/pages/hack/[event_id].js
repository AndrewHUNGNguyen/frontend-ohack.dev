          <Typography component="ol">
            <li>
              <strong>Real-world impact:</strong> We focus on creating lasting
              solutions for nonprofits, not just demo projects.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Open-ended challenges:</strong> Unlike hackathons with
              predefined ideas, we present open-ended problems from nonprofits,
              encouraging truly innovative and tailored solutions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Code-centric approach:</strong> We minimize workshops to
              maximize coding time, emphasizing hands-on learning and
              development.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Professional leadership:</strong> Our events are run by
              industry professionals passionate about coding for social good,
              not by students.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Long-term support:</strong> We provide resources and
              mentorship for teams to continue development post-event.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Recognition system:</strong> Our 'Hearts' system
              acknowledges ongoing volunteer contributions.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Year-round community:</strong> We foster a strong network
              of socially-conscious technologists through continuous engagement.
